To set project:

clone the repo.
do npm install in the root folder (katrin-test).
do npm install in the client (katrin-test/client).
do npm install in the server (katrin-test/server).


To start project:

you need two terminals to run this project.



one for the server: 

cd into server folder.
once in it do npx nodemon to start the server.
the server will run in the live in the background and will keep updating if you change something in the server folder;



one for the client:

cd into the client folder.
once in it do npm start;






Thank you!
